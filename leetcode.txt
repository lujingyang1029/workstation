1. Add a new branch using the git: git branch -M  master to generate a master branch
2. Generate to worstation git
3  push the master branch to the git
here comes the problem: I had the same error & spent hours trying to figure it out. Finally I found it. What I didn't know is that pushing like this git push origin branch-x will try to search for branch-x locally then push to remote branch-x.
4: I am trying to add a new branch and push them all to the remote repository got a upstream words no idea what it is
